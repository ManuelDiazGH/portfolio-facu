        <p>
            The interest in software development started in the year 2021, while I was still in high school.
            I was always interested in learning about technology since my childhood, besides the fact that I really love outdoor sports.

            By the year 2023, i discover an amazing tool that you probably know About called "AI".
            In the beggining it was just a new feature for me... but when i start using it, i discover the potential that it has and all the posibilities that you can make reality.
            So then decided to start learning Python. Since then, my delevoper journey has continued evolving to another fields too.
